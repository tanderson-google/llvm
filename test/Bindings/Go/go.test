; Disable this for now to allow cmake builds with libc++.
; The bindings test tries build a bunch of things and then link against
; the LLVM libraries, but the build script that it uses within the test
; does not pick up changes to CMAKE_C*_FLAGS so if we change that then
; the link commandline is wrong:
; https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=21552
; https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=4119
; Add "-x" to the below commandline to get more verbose output.
